# Password Generator

# Overview

The Password Generator is a web application built using React.js that enables users to generate secure and customizable passwords with ease. It provides a simple and intuitive user interface that empowers users to create strong passwords, helping them enhance the security of their online accounts and sensitive information.

# Features

# Password Strength Indicator: 
The password generator includes a dynamic strength indicator that evaluates the complexity of the generated password. It provides visual cues through color changes (red, orange, green) and labels (weak, medium, great) to help users understand the strength of their password.
# Slider-controlled Password Length: 
Users can adjust the desired length of the generated password using a slider. The slider ranges from a minimum of 5 characters to a maximum of 15 characters. The user experience is further enhanced by a live preview of the password length.
# Password Copy Functionality:
To streamline the process of copying the generated password, the application features an innovative copy button with an integrated SVG icon. Users can click the copy button to instantly copy the generated password to their clipboard, eliminating the need to manually select the password.
